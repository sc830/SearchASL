### SearchASL ###
SearchASL is a personal-use application that allows the user to store and search American Sign Language signs based on their identifying attributes. This application is a passion project that I conceptualized after my frustration in using similar online tools. Its main function is the sign search, which organizes results based on most likely to least likely to be the desired results based on its similarity to the search criteria, ignoring blank fields.

### Technologies ###
SearchASL utilizes Firebase web hosting as well as Firestore cloud storage to allow users to sign up, sign in, and access their own personal database of signs which is automatically populated with a preset collection upon account creation. Users can customize this database to suit their practice needs, personal knowledge, or region/dialect. This application was created with React.NATIVE to create a robust, easily extensible application that can be accessed via web or mobile app.

### Development ###
March 2024: Since beginning development of this project, I have become proficient in new and powerful technologies that I believe will improve the functionality, practicality, and maintainability of this application. I've decided to begin again with a clean slate to bring this project to life as a React app with full Firestore integration so that users are able to customize their contect, access the app from anywhere, and don't consume system resources to learn, practice, and review ASL. The use of React will make it more attainable to integrate new features such as practice mode, full sentence English to ASL translation, and possibly integration with a large-language model to help users learn and practice American Sign Language.

May 2023: This application in periodic part-time development. My ultimate goal is to integrate Firebase into this app so that each user's data can be accessed from anywhere, and data can be shared between users. I also aim to implement Python scripting to source GIFs for each sign more easily and provide links to sign definitions that are not found within the user's data.

~~This project is coded in Java and uses Java Swing for GUI design, as well as JUnit for testing. Ultimately Firebase and Python may be integrated as well.~~

Usage
Replace webhook variables with webhooks to user's Discord server, with different webhooks for each channel. Currently, this file is presented as a Jupyter Notebook file, and must be edited manually to adjust the user's stock portfolio and purchase prices. Eventually, I hope to design a GUI to make this process easier and more attractive.

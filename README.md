### SearchASL ###
This is a personal-use application that allows the user to store and search ASL signs based on their identifying attributes. Its main function is the sign search, which organizes results based on most likely to least likely to be the desired results based on its similarity to the search criteria, ignoring blank fields.

### Development ###
This application began development in May 2023 and has been in periodic part-time development. My ultimate goal is to integrate Firebase into this app so that each user's data can be accessed from anywhere, and data can be shared between users. I also aim to implement Python scripting to source GIFs for each sign more easily and provide links to sign definitions that are not found within the user's data.

### Technologies ###
This project is coded in Java and uses Java Swing for GUI design, as well as JUnit for testing. Ultimately Firebase and Python may be integrated as well.
